Burn_Query
==========

A HDF5 Query Generation tool design for use with the Burn package and SNSPH. 

Created because I got sick of writing subtly different variations of the same
code to perform queries for a research project. 

A work in progress, and always welcome to commentary and feedback regarding
features to add or ways to improve the code.
