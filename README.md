Burn_Query
==========

A HDF5 Query Generation tool design for use with the Burn package and SNSPH. 

Created because I got sick of writing subtly different variations of the same
code to perform queries for a research project. 

A work in progress, and always welcome to commentary and feedback regarding
features to add or ways to improve the code.

To build the code simply use the makefile as per usual, requires SE to be installed 
(http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/nugrid/work-packages/io-technologies/hdf5-useepp-format/installing-se) 
and defaults to looking for it in your HOME directory. Since this will run principally in 
remote systems I imagine you shouldn't need to change this, but the Makefile is very simple 
and can be readily modified as needed.
